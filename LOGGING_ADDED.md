# 🔍 Debugging Added - Next Steps

## What I Just Fixed:

### 1. Added Comprehensive Logging to API
The `/agenda/plan-nl` endpoint now logs:
- ✅ When LangGraph completes
- ✅ Number of sections in the agenda
- ✅ First section title
- ✅ What's being returned to the client
- ✅ Section count in final payload

###  2. Node Logging Already Partially in Place
- ✅ `parse_and_understand` - Has full logging
- ✅ `analyze_context` - Has start logging
- ⚠️ Other nodes - Need completion logs added

## 🧪 Next Test:

**Run this query again:**
```
faça a pauta da minha próxima reunião com a BYD
```

**Check the server logs for lines like:**
```
✅ LangGraph completed - Result keys: [...]
📊 LangGraph agenda has X sections  
📋 First section: ...
📤 Returning JSON with refs - Sections: X
📤 Full payload sections: [...]
```

## 🐛 What To Look For:

1. **If sections > 1 in LangGraph but only 1 in final payload:**
   - Issue is in `textgen.agenda_to_json()` formatting

2. **If sections = 1 throughout:**
   - Issue is in `build_agenda` node (not creating multiple sections)

3. **If "Abertura" is the only section:**
   - Template issue - agenda builder only creating opening section

## 💡 Likely Root Cause:

Based on your output showing only "Abertura" (Opening), the issue is probably in the `build_agenda` node not properly using the intent template to create all sections. The intent templates define multiple sections (opening, main topics, decisions, etc.) but only the first one is being rendered.

## 🔧 Quick Fix If It's Template Issue:

Check `agent/graph/nodes.py` around line 448 (build_agenda function) and `agent/intent/templates.py` to ensure all sections from the template are being included in the final agenda.

## 📝 What The Logs Will Show:

The new logging will print something like:

```
INFO: 🔄 [parse_and_understand] Parsing natural language query...
INFO: ✅ [parse_and_understand] Complete: Subject: Reunião BYD, Language: pt-BR
INFO: 🔄 [analyze_context] Analyzing recent meetings and context...
INFO: 🔄 [detect_intent] Detecting meeting intent...
INFO: 🔄 [retrieve_facts] Retrieving facts with multi-strategy approach...
INFO: 🔄 [build_agenda] Building agenda based on intent template...
INFO: ✅ LangGraph completed - Result keys: ['proposal', 'metadata', 'subject', 'org_id']
INFO: 📊 LangGraph agenda has 5 sections
INFO: 📋 First section: Abertura
INFO: 📤 Returning JSON with refs - Sections: 5
INFO: 📤 Full payload sections: ['Abertura', 'Decisões Estratégicas', 'Riscos e Bloqueadores', 'Próximos Passos', 'Encerramento']
```

If you see **5 sections** in LangGraph but only **1** in the final output, we know exactly where to look!

**👉 Please run another test and share the server logs!** That will tell us exactly what's happening.
